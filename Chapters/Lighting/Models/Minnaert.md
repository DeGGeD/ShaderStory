## Lighting Models : Minnaert

> The **Minnaert Model** was originally designed to replicate the way light scatters off the surface of the moon. That is why its also called the **Moon Shader**.

Unlike Lambertian lighting, which assumes light scatters evenly in all directions, Minnaert introduces a view-dependent component. This makes it ideal for simulating materials where light tends to backscatter, such as:

- Porous surfaces: **dust**, **chalk**
- Fibrous materials: **velvet**, **velour**, **suede**, **carpets**
- Soft, rough surfaces: **cloth**, **unpolished stone**

The result is a shading effect where surfaces facing the viewer look slightly darker or lighter depending on the chosen roughness parameter. It produces a soft, velvety look that‚Äôs very close to the more complex Oren-Nayar model, but cheaper to compute.

// Lambertian cosine falloff
float NdotL = max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, lightDirection));
float NdotV = max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, viewDirection));

// Minnaert factor (view-dependent diffuse)
float minnaertFactor = saturate(NdotL pow(NdotL NdotV, _Roughness));

// Apply diffuse color
float3 lightingModel = minnaertFactor * diffuseColor;

// Light attenuation and final output
float attenuation = LIGHT_ATTENUATION(i);
float3 attenColor = attenuation * _LightColor0.rgb;
half4 finalColor = half4(lightingModel * attenColor, 1.0);

### Basic idea

Light travels from the source, hits the surface, and reaches the viewer.

- **Diffuse (Lambertian):** Compute the cosine falloff (dot(N, L)) to measure how directly light hits the surface.
- **View Dependency:** Compute dot(N, V) to measure how directly the viewer looks at the surface.
- **Minnaert Adjustment:** Multiply dot(N, L) by (dot(N, L) x dot(N, V))^k to darken grazing angles based on the chosen roughness k.
- **Final Shading:** Multiply the Minnaert factor by the surface diffuse color, light color, and attenuation to get the final shaded result.


### Half-Lambertian Equation

> d = Œ£ (from i=0 to n) [ I_i x atten_i x diffuseFactor x clamp( (max(0.0, dot(N, L_i)))^(1.0 + k) x (max(0.0, dot(N, V)))^k , 0.0, 1.0 ) ]

Where:

**I_i**‚Äã - per-light intensity & color
**atten_i**‚Äã - per-light attenuation (distance/shadows)
**N** - surface normal
**L_i**‚Äã - light direction
**V** - view direction
**k** - Minnaert exponent (roughness):
- k=0 - plain Lambertian
- k>0 - darkens edges
