## Lighting Models : Blinn-Phong

> Blinn-Phong shading is one of the most widely used lighting models in real-time graphics, extending [Lambertian](https://github.com/DeGGeD/ShaderStory/blob/main/Chapters/Lighting/Models/Lambertian.md) lighting by adding specular highlights.

While [Lambertian](https://github.com/DeGGeD/ShaderStory/blob/main/Chapters/Lighting/Models/Lambertian.md) is excellent for simulating matte surfaces like chalk, clay, or fabric, Blinn-Phong brings materials to life by introducing a shiny, reflective component, perfect for **plastic**, **polished wood**, **metals**, and other **glossy surfaces**.

Its strength lies in its simplicity: brightness depends only on the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the incoming light direction. This is known as Lambert‚Äôs Cosine Law.

```hlsl
// World-space directions
half3 viewDirection = normalize(_WorldSpaceCameraPos.xyz - i.posWorld.xyz);
half3 halfDirection = normalize(viewDirection + lightDirection);

// Diffuse (Lambertian)
float NdotL = max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, lightDirection));

// Specular (Blinn-Phong)
half NdotH = max(0.0, dot(normalDirection, halfDirection));
half3 specularity = pow(NdotH, SpecularGloss) * SpecularPower * _SpecularColor.rgb;

// Combine
half3 lightingModel = NdotL * diffuseColor + specularity;

// Light attenuation & final color
half attenuation = LIGHT_ATTENUATION(i);
half3 attenColor = attenuation * _LightColor0.rgb;

half4 finalColor = float4(lightingModel * attenColor, 1.0);

```

### Basic idea

Light travels from the source, bounces off the surface, and reaches the viewer.
- **Diffuse (Lambertian)**: Light scattered evenly in all directions, giving the object its base diffuse color.
- **Specular (Blinn-Phong)**: Light reflected in a concentrated direction, creating highlights that shift as the camera moves.

Blinn-Phong computes both contributions per pixel (or per vertex). Result - smooth, physically plausible appearance for most real-time use cases.

### Blinn-Phong Equation

>d = Œ£ (from i=0 to n) [I_i x atten_i x (max(0.0, dot(N, L_i))‚Äã‚Äã √ó DiffuseColor + SpecularColor x max(0.0, dot(N, H_i)^Œ±))]

- Summation over lightssum the contribution of every incident light source.
- **I_i**‚Äã - Light intensity / colorThe light‚Äôs color and intensity (e.g. _LightColor0.rgb). Scales both diffuse and specular contributions.
- **atten_i**‚Äã - Light attenuationDistance falloff and shadowing per light (0..1). Multiplies both diffuse and specular terms so highlights dim with distance like diffuse light.
- **DiffuseColor**‚Äã - Surface diffuse propertyMaterial diffuse color/scale (0 ‚Üí black, 1 ‚Üí full reflection).
- **max(0, N‚ãÖL_i‚Äã)** - Diffuse cosine factorLambert‚Äôs cosine law: how directly the light hits the surface. Ensures no negative contribution when light is behind the surface.
- **SpecularColor**‚Äã - Surface specular property / colorThe specular color or intensity: controls highlight tint and strength (metals often tint specular, dielectrics use white specular).
- **H_i**‚Äã - Half-vector (per light)H = normalize(L+V), where V is the view (camera) direction. Approximates the reflection alignment more cheaply and stably than computing the reflection vector R.
- **max‚Å°(0, ‚Äâdot(N, ‚Å£‚Äâ‚Å£H_i)^Œ±** - Blinn-Phong specular lobe
Measures how aligned the surface normal is with the half-vector. Raising to the power Œ± (commonly called shininess, glossiness, or specular exponent) controls the lobe width:
  - Low Œ± ‚Üí broad, soft highlights (rough surface)
  - High Œ± ‚Üí tight, sharp highlights (polished/smooth surface)

Clamping **max(0.0, ...)** prevents negative values and avoids lighting effect happening when the geometry faces away.
