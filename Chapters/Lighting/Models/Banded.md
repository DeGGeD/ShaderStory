## Lighting Models : Banded

> **Banded lighting** (also known as **cel lighting**) quantizes smooth lighting into discrete brightness bands.
Instead of a continuous gradient from light to dark, you are able to get the distinct ‚Äústeps‚Äù. Its a common technique in e.g. comic rendering.

It‚Äôs one of the simplest yet most effective ways to give 3D objects a hand-painted, non-photorealistic feel.

float additive = numSteps * (useHalfStep ? 1.0 : 0.5);

// Quantize smooth lighting into discrete bands

banded = saturate(banded);

// Combine with diffuse term and light color
return banded * diffuseIntensity * lightColor;

### Basic idea

Banded lighting takes smooth shading (like Lambert) and breaks it into a few flat tones. Commonly applied technique, just like in cartoon or cel-shaded art.

It starts with regular lighting:
- Calculate how much the surface faces the light using the dot product (N ¬∑ L). This gives a smooth gradient from bright to dark.

Then, gradient should be turned into bands:
- Instead of keeping it smooth, the brightness is "quantized" - rounding it down into a few fixed levels.

Control the smoothness:
- TDedicated properties define how many bands appear and how wide each one is.
More steps = smoother look.
Fewer steps = bold, stylized shading.

(Optionally) Bands offset applied:
- The half-step factor shifts the light bands slightly, helping to center them and avoid harsh transitions.


### Equation

> L_banded = floor((max(0, N ¬∑ L) √ó s + a) / n) √ó (n / s)

Where:

- **N ¬∑ L** - Lambertian diffuse
- **s** - lighting step size (smoothness)
- **a** - additive offset (half-step factor toggle)
- **n** - number of light bands

This quantized diffuse factor replaces the smooth falloff used in traditional Lambert or Blinn-Phong lighting.
