## Lighting Models : Ambient Lighting & Hemi Lights

In real-time rendering, light defines form, depth, and mood. While direct lighting (such as Lambertian or Blinn-Phong) handles illumination from explicit sources, the world also needs **Ambient** and **Hemi (hemispheric)** lighting to simulate the contribution of the environment.

**Ambient light** ensures surfaces in shadow are never completely black, while **Hemi** lights provide a smooth gradient between the **ground** and the **sky**, enriching the sense of directionality even without strong light sources.

// Initialize lighting contribution
float3 colorLighting = 0

// Sample Spherical Harmonics (SH) baked into the scene
float3 ambient = SampleSH(normalWS)
colorLighting += ambient

// Use the Y component of the normal to blend between ground and sky
half mask = remap(normalWS.y, -1, 1, 0, 1)
mask = pow(abs(mask), HemiContrast)
float3 hemi = lerp(TintGround, TintSky, mask) * HemiPower
colorLighting += hemi

// Final color
float4 colorOutput = float4(colorBase * saturate(colorLighting), 1.0)

### Basic idea

- **Ambient Lighting:**
Represents global light coming from the environment, regardless of direction. It ensures all objects are lit to some degree, preventing harsh black shadows. In modern rendering, ambient light is often provided via Spherical Harmonics (SH), which captures low-frequency environment lighting.

- **Hemi Lighting:**
A simplified model for directional environmental light. It blends between two colors - sky and ground. They are based on the surface‚Äôs upward or downward orientation. Surfaces facing up receive more of the sky tint, while downward-facing surfaces receive more of the ground tint. This provides a natural gradient and emphasizes orientation relative to the environment.


### Equation

Ambient Lighting:
> L_ambient = SH(n)

where **n** is the surface normal and **SH(n)** is the evaluation of spherical harmonics.

Hemi Lighting:
> L_hemi = ((1 - m) x C_ground + m x C_sky) * P

where:
- **m** = remap(n.y, -1, 1, 0, 1) ^ contrast
- **n.y** - Y-component of the surface normal
- **C_ground**, **C_sky** - sky/ground tint colors
- **P** - global intensity

Final Color:
> C_out = C_base * saturate(L_ambient + L_hemi)

Keep in mind that Ambient and Hemi lighting are not complete lighting models. They only approximate how the environment influences surfaces.
