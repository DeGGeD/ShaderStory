# Shader Story: A Journey into Shaders and Graphics Programming

> “When love and skill work together, expect a masterpiece.”  
> — *John Ruskin*

**Shader Story** is a free, open educational resource exploring **real-time graphics**, **shader programming**, and **technical art techniques**.

This is a **side project of [Decompiled Art](https://www.youtube.com/@DecompiledArt)** — a broader initiative focused on deep-dive tutorials, shader analysis, rendering pipelines, and graphics programming tools. Shader Story brings those same insights into an **open-source**, **accessible format** — built for **learning**, **reference**, and **hands-on experimentation**.
